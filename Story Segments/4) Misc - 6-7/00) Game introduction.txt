Welcome to The Vaguely Parable.
This is a somewhat satirical game where your voice is the controller!
Story segments are presented, and the last sentence always contains the phrase "Vaguely decided to".
This last sentence will also guide you on what you can do next.
Once the sentence is finished, you can guide Vaguely on her journey!
Good luck!
