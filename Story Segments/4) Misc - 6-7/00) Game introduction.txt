Welcome to The Vaguely Parable.
This is a somewhat satiricle game where your voice is the controller!
Story segments are presented, and the last sentance always contains the phrase "Vaguely decided to".
This last sentance will also guide you on what you can do next. Once the sentance is finished, you can guide Vaguely on her journey!
Good luck!
