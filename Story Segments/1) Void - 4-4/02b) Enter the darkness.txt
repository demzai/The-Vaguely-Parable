Deciding that the light was clearly a trap, Vaguely began to walk away from the light.
Trying to catch up to at least one of the phone booths, she began a canter, and eventually motioned into a run.
Focussing solely on the phone booth ahead of her, Vaguely lost her footing and began to fall.

Gasping as she fell into an abyss she thought to herself “What happened? Where is everyone? Why am I falling? How long have I been falling for?”.
The questions and absurdity of what was happening to Vaguely left her feeling dizzy, before slipping off into a quiet slumber.
