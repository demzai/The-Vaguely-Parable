A while passed as Vaguely gathered the energy to pry the block out, seemingly for no reason other than to satiate a morbid curiosity.
Heaving it out, she lays back, exhausted.
“Hello?!”
Wait What was that? Vaguely lay stunned.
“Helloooooo?”
A cry, a call! Could someone be reaching out to Vaguely?

Frightened, Vaguely decided to cover her ears and ignore the strange voice until it went away.
