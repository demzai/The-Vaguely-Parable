Inextricably, a sense of trepidation overcame Vaguely.
Fearing the light, she ran away as fast as she could!
Panicking, and looking back in case something was chasing her, she ran and ran.
When, suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere, she had the floor ripped from under her!
Vaguely screamed as she fell into the abyss.
"What is going on? Where is everyone? Why am I falling? When is this nightmare going to end?" she thought.
Before... nothing.
