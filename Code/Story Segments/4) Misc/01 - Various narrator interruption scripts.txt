Do you terribly mind, I'm trying to present the story to you!
I can't very well do so if you're constantly interrupting me now can I?!


*Silence*
No, carry on. Don't let me interrupt you with all my narrating.
*Silence until user silent*
Finished?
*Silence for a bit unless user continues with anything other than yes*
Thank you, now, where was I...


That's it! If you really want to listen to my story, then come find me when you're actually finished! Hmph.
*Game quits*
