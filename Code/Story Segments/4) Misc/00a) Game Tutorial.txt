Welcome to 'The Vaguely Parable'.
This is a somewhat satirical game, where your voice is the controller!
Story segments are narrated, with the last sentence always containing the phrase, 'Vaguely decided to'.
This last sentence will guide you on what you can do next.

For example, 'After leaving her bedroom, Vaguely decided to look for her friends.'
From here, you could say 'Vaguely looked around', or you might try, 'do nothing'.
Or, if you're feeling particularly adventurous you could say, 'go back into the bedroom'.

Lets give it a try, shall we?
When the narrator asked Vaguely if she was ready to play, Vaguely decided to say 'yes'.
