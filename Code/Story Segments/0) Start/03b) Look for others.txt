After searching innumerable phone booths, Vaguely noticed something out the corner of her eye.
Down there.
At the end of the hall?
A bright light pierced through.
Perhaps someone had just opened a door?

Overjoyed at the possible sign of life, Vaguely decided to run towards the light.

#ignore("do_nothing")
// Going around the light?
