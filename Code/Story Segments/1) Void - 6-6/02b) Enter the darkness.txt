Deciding that the light was clearly a trap, Vaguely began to walk away from the light.
Trying to catch up to at least one of the phone booths, she began a canter, and eventually motioned toward a run.
Without warning, with her focus solely on the phone booth ahead, Vaguely lost her footing and began to fall off an apparent ledge.

Gasping, stunned, Vaguely began thinking to herself “What happened? Where is everyone? Why am I falling? How long have I been falling for?”
The thoughts persisted as she fell into this deep abyss leaving Vaguely feeling dizzy, before slipping off into a quiet slumber.
