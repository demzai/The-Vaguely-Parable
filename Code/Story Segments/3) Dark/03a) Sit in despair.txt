Vaguely accepted the futility of trying, and allowed the well to swallow her whole.
Hollow minutes turned into desperate days.
Desperate days decayed to yearning years.
And those yearning years bled into miserable millennia.
All was dragged into the darkest void, and all was lost to time.

Ending: Give Up.
