// First Time:
Vaguely heaved herself up...
The rocks were slippery, causing her to occasionally fall, but this could not dissuade her.
She tried, and kept on trying; succumbing to the weight of the heavy chains every now and then.
But finally... against all the odds... Vaguely managed to grasp what felt like a ledge!
"Is this it, is this the top", she wondered.
With a last heave, she pulled herself up and out of the well.
